## Introduction

This project is designed to demonstrate proficiency in frontend development by building a responsive web application that displays a list of games and their details. It leverages Next.js for server-side rendering and optimized performance.

## Features

- Display a list of games
- View detailed information about each game
- Responsive design
- Optimized for performance
- Progressive Web App 

## Technologies Used

- Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- JavaScript: Programming language for web development
- TypeScript: Typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
- HTML: Markup language for creating web pages
- CSS: Style sheet language for styling web pages
- TailwindCSS: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development

## Development Process

- Planning: Outlined the project requirements and created a basic structure for the application.
- Setup: Initialized a new Next.js project and configured the necessary dependencies.
- Design: Created the layout and design using TailwindCSS and plain CSS for a responsive and modern look.
- Implementation: Developed the core features including game listing and detailed view, create resuable components in components folder,  .
- Testing: Conducted manual testing to ensure functionality and responsiveness across different devices and browsers.
- Optimization: Improved performance and fixed any bugs identified during testing.
- PWA: Used next-pwa package to generate service worker file so that app behaves as native application.

## Decision-Making Journey

- Framework Choice: Chose Next.js for its robust server-side rendering, Optimization technique like using Suspense and Dyanmic import of components, Image tag from next/image and next technique capabilities and ease of integration with React.
- Styling: Decided to use both TailwindCSS for utility-first styling and plain CSS for layouts, root styles and CSS variables, combining the strengths of both approaches.
- TypeScript: Used TypeScript to catch potential errors early and improve code maintainability.
- Component Structure: Structured components to be reusable and modular, facilitating easier maintenance and scalability.
